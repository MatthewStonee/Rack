# Liftly

A personal iOS fitness and workout programming app built with SwiftUI. Liftly helps you build structured training programs, log sets and reps, and track your progress over time.

## Features

- **Program Builder** — Create and manage training programs made up of workout days. Add exercises to each day with planned sets, reps, and target weight.
- **Progress Tracking** — View per-exercise progress charts (weight over time), personal records, and a full log of recent sets. Filter by time range to see short or long-term trends.
- **Quick Log** — Log a set for any exercise on the fly, without needing an active workout session.
- **Exercise Library** — Browse exercises filtered by muscle group. Create custom exercises inline when adding to a workout.

## Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI** — All UI, dark mode first
- **SwiftData** — Local persistence, no third-party dependencies
- **Swift Charts** — Progress visualizations
- **MVVM** — ViewModels own all business logic; Views are purely presentational

## Requirements

- iOS 26.2+
- Xcode 26+
